# TensorBoard Introduction


To support model evaluation during training, the FAIRiCUBE Hub processing environment is also extended by a TensorBoard to support the tracking of individual experiments and training runs. This tool can be used with PyTorch and TensorFlow, and it provides a state-of-the-art toolset for data scientist to inspect the tuning and training process and compare metrics.
