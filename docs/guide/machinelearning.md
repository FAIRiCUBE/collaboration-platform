# Machine learning

Machine learning is a field of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn from data and improve their performance over time without being explicitly programmed. It involves algorithms that can recognize patterns, make decisions, and predict outcomes based on historical information. Essentially, itâ€™s like teaching a computer to think and adapt like a human, but using vast amounts of data and statistical analysis.
