## Query tool
Its interactive [Query Tool](https://fairicube-kb.dev.epsilon-italia.it/query-tool) allows both experts and non-experts to easily discover and analyse the FAIRiCUBE data analysis and processing resources (pipelines, pre-processing, ML models and algorithms …).
Use it to discover and analyse the processing resources of the use cases and their assets (datasets, pre-trained models, code libraries …) through the accurate descriptions contained in the related metadata.
Perform searches using keywords and pre-defined queries, or create your custom query (recommended for advanced users only).

## Tips & Tricks
Its [Tips & Tricks](https://fairicube-kb.dev.epsilon-italia.it/tips-and-tricks) document the challenges faced by the use cases and related solutions, workarounds, failures and lessons learnt.
